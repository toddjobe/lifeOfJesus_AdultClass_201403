Hosea was the only Bible prophet to hail from the northern kingdom of Israel.  Hosea's prophecies and indeed his own life were extreme and shocking, matching the extreme unfaithfulness of Israel.  In the beginning of the book he is commanded to go marry a prostitude, Gomer, so that his children will not be his own.  Gomer, is as predicted, unfaithful to Hosea, yet God commands him to keep Gomer and love her as God loves Israel.
