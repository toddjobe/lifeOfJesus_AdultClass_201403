Seven of the nine beatitudes focus on the condition of our heart.\\~\\
\begin{quote}
For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and \textbf{discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart}.

What I am eager for is that all the Christians there will be filled with \textbf{love that comes from pure hearts},and that their minds will be clean and their faith strong.

And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ``Son, your sins are forgiven.''

\begin{quote}
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.
